## SQL-Python-Pipeline Project
### Part 2: Data Pipeline
In this section of the project, we have implemented a Python script responsible for downloading the 10minutes.xml file,
extracting relevant information, and storing it in a database. The script also performs real-time queries on the stored data.

### Part 3: SQL and Python Integration
This section involves a Python script and an SQL query designed to work together seamlessly.
